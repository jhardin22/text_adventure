# Blue Room Story

As you step through, you find yourself in a comfortably lit hallway. A blue carpet runs down the hall and around the corner. The air in the hall is warm, and there is a a faint smell of another person in the air. The feeling of excitement falls as you walk
down the hall, but something about the smell keeps the feeling from leaving you completely.
You reach the end of the hall and find an open doorway with a sign that reads 'Blue Room'.

## Entry (start)

A man sits at a desk in the room, writing in a book. He looks up as you enter and smiles. Hope and excitement inexplicably swell again.

> "Wow, I've been here for ages. It's good to see you. I've been alone for a long time. Would you like to sit with me?"

**Choices:**

- [SIT] -> sit_branch
- [TALK] -> talk_branch  
- [LEAVE] -> leave_branch

## Sit Together (sit)

You sit down and start talking to the man. His name is John. He tells you about his life and how he has been cursed to stay in the room. As the two of you talk the feeling of hope and excitement ebbs and flows. Something inside of you is drawn to the man and the room.

> "Will you marry me?"

The question comes out of nowhere. You're not sure how to respond at first, but the longer you sit with the question the more certain you become.

**Choices:**

- [YES] → proposal_yes (REWARD: wedding_band, FLAG: blue_room_complete)
- [NO] → proposal_no (REWARD: figurine, FLAG: blue_room_complete)

## Talk Togther (talk)

You take a deep breath and reign in your excitement. You give him your name and ask for his. He tells you his name is John. You ask him how he came to be in the room. He tells you that he's been here for a long time, but he can't remember how he got here. He tells you that he's been alone for so long, and he's glad to have someone to talk to. You talk for a while, and the feeling of hope and excitement grows. There's nothing special about him or the room you that you can see, but you feel like you could stay here forever with him. Something inside you tells you that staying in the room would be a bad thing, but some sort of bond has been forged between you and John. You ask him if he wants to leave the room with you.

> 'I can't leave the room,' he says. 'I'm stuck here.'

Underneath the feeling of hope and excitement, you feel a deep sadness. You know you can't stay, but you can't leave John either.

>'I'm sorry,' you say. 'I can't stay here. How can I help you?'

A hopeful look crosses his face.

>'Will you marry me?'

The question comes out of nowhere. You're not sure how to respond at first, but the longer you sit with the question the more certain you become.

**Choices:**

- [YES] → proposal_yes (REWARD: wedding_band, FLAG: blue_room_complete)
- [NO] → proposal_no (REWARD: figurine, FLAG: blue_room_complete)

## Leave (leave)

Terminal: True

You take a deep breath and reign in your excitement. Something about this place is pressing on you, making you feel things that you can tell aren't from you.

>'I'm sorry!' you blurt.

Underneath the feeling of hope and excitement, you feel fear rising in you. You turn and run from the room, but the feeling of hope and excitement follows you, somehow still present even in the face of your growing terror. You run down the hall and back through the door, but the feelings all stay with you. A tide of pressure and emotion that you can't shake.

You black out."

## Proposal Accepted (proposal_yes)

You say yes! Tears fill your eyes and the eyes of the man. The two of you get up from the table and hold hands. You walk to a bed in the corner of the room, sheltered by a screen. As the two of you sit together, the feeling of hope and excitement has given way to satisfaction and contentment. The man leans in and kisses you.

>'I love you. Thank you for loving me. I'm trapped here, but take this so we can be together and remember each other.

The man holds out his hand and shows you two rings. As you reach out to touch them, he takes your left hand and puts a small thin band on your ring finger.

>'Would you play me a song?'

You pull out the flute and play a joyful tune. Music fills the room, and the lights seem to grow brighter. After you finish the song, you reach down and put the other ring on the hand of the man. You promise your undying love to him. As the ring slips over his last knuckle, suddenly the room starts to fade. You grab on to the headboard of the bed, but a feeling of grief and loss washes over you, as the room fades to black.

Something warm and wet rubs across your face. You open your eyes to see the dog licking your face.

>'You're awake! I was worried you'd never wake up. You've been out for a while.' 

/- "You found, and lost the love of your life."

## Proposal Denied (proposal_no)

Terminal: true

You sit and stare for a moment.

> "...No"

The word surprises you as it comes to your lips. There's part of you that can feel the undeniably deep connection the two of you share now. But another part of you can't accept the proposal. Something in this place is pressing on your mind, and you don't trust yourself to make your own choices. John looks sad for a moment, and then peacefully resigned.

> "All right. It's okay, I understand. You shouldn't stay here much longer. You couldn't actually, even if you wanted to. Please, take this with you before you go;"

He presses a dark lump into your hands and closes them both over it before you can see what it is. As he pulls his hands away from yours, you look into his eyes, surprise and confusion now being accompanied by disorientation. A sense of emotional pain and grief begin to swell, uniting the feelings running through you like a root chord. The room begins to fade, and a darkness seems to start crawling inward from the edges of your vision. You have just enough time to gasp out,

> "...Wait, what-"

Suddenly your legs give out from under you and you fall to your knees. As your vision clears, you can see a while fluffy shape coming over to you, sniffing eagerly at the lump in your hands. As the emotions swell and surge in your head like a tide, you look down and see that you're holding a carved wooden statue, its a man kneeling, holding some kind of hoop out in front of him. The dog speaks, shocking you out of a reverie.

> "Seems like you found something interesting, I wonder what it's for? Do you have any bacon?"
